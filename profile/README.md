## Republic of Melonia
The official GitHub page for the online Minecraft nation, the Republic of Melonia.

### What is the Republic of Melonia?
The Republic of Melonia is a Constitutional Republic government in a Minecraft server with a democratically elected President, Speaker of Parliament and Members of Parliament. The President appoints a Prime Minister, who then appoints ministers of "Cabinets" to execute the law. Citizens are to abide by the government's laws and regulations, and in return receive services.

We have fun building and expanding the Republic as a tight-knit community, with leadership and 24-page Constitutions along the way.
